# JobSiteNotifications

This script is intended to check job sites for updates in various keywords, however it can be used for any similar purpose.
The script will provide a windows notification toast and remain in the notification centre when an update is detected.
You will need to update the urls for sites you wish to use, and edit the path to your history.txt file.

You will need requests, bs4, time, datetime, win10toast libraries.
